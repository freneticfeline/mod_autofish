# AutoFish Forge Mod by FreneticFeline

AutoFish Forge Mod is a Minecraft mod that provides the option to automatically reel
in and re-cast the fishing rod when a nibble is detected.  Additional options include
MultiRod, which automatically switches to the next available fishing rod in the hotbar
when the current rod breaks; and Break Protection, which will stop using a rod before
it breaks.

## Installation Requirements
AutoFish Forge Mod versions 1.x-y.z require Minecraft 1.x with compatible version
of MinecraftForge installed.

## Installation Instructions
Copy the `mod_autofish_forge-1.8-x.x.jar` file to the `mods` directory in your Minecraft
data directory.

## Usage Instructions
By default, AutoFish is enabled, but MultiRod and Break Protection are disabled.  To change
these options, Click the **[Mods]** button from the opening Minecraft screen, locate the
AutoFish Forge Mod in the mods list, and click the **[Configure]** button.

The AutoFish Forge Mod options can also be reached in-game using the configured hotkey.
_Note that the hotkey will only function if the item currently in use by the player is a fishing rod._
By default, the hotkey is the letter `o`, but this binding can be changed or disabled in the
standard Minecraft **Controls** screen.

## Development Setup Instructions
Follow the standard Forge mod development setup instructions.  They can be found
in the file named `README-MinecraftForge.txt`
